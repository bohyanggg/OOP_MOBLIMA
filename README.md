# SC2002 Object Oriented Design and Programming

## Learning Outcome
**object oriented programming(OOP)** in both **Java and C++**. The coursework includes a group project where our group has accomplished building a functional **movie booking and listing management application(console-based app)** by applying various **OOP design patterns and concepts**. 

## Coursework Group Project

- Uses various ``OOP design`` and ``concepts``
- Includes features such as viewing movie showtimes at any selected cineplex, booking of movie tickets including the selection of seats as well as viewing/editing past bookings etc.
- Similar to the actual booking flow used at cineplexes except it is console-based for user's input and output.
- the storage of data is local and utilizes serialization (i.e. the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored)
